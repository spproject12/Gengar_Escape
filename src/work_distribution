Game brief:
-----------------
----short story :

Gengar Escape: Whisper of Forbidden Memories is a story-driven adventure where you step into the shadowy world of Gengar, once the most cherished Pokemon of his trainer. After a mysterious encounter in the Old Chateau, the trainer and Gengar captured a powerful Dragapult,unaware of the cold darkness that came with it. Manipulated by Dragapults sinister influence, the trainer slowly turned away from Gengar, eventually abandoning him in the legendary Castle of Lost Souls, hidden within the ancient Ruins of Alph.\nAlone and surrounded by the whispers of forgotten spirits, Gengar must navigate four perilous trap rooms of the castle.Each chamber is a physical manifestation of his deepest emotions: guilt , loneliness, confusion, and pain.\n Along the way, Gengar confronts puzzles, enemies, and ultimately, a monstrous form born from all his pain, inferiority, and sorrow, now standing between him and freedom.To escape, Gengar must conquer his worst fears, overcome the traps of his own heart, and uncover the truth behind his betrayal. Will he remain a lost whisper among the forsaken, or will he rise above the shadows to reclaim his destiny? The question persists.
